# Roseninselachter-Rennmanagement
This is the (unofficial) Roseninselachter-Software. It is designed for this specific rowing-event and is verry usecase-specific.

## "Core"-Features *(see milestones for expansion-plans)*
- Import of all data from the Exel-sheets
- Editing of the importied data
- Automatically create a division into a variatable amount of sets.
  -  It decides this based on if collisions occur (i.e. Boat is used twice, an athlete is used twice, ...) and if possible on some optimisations (i.e. children start first thing in the morning, ...)
- Being able to search and filter the data on race-day
- Marking, who has already paid


## UI
